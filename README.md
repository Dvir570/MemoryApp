# Memory Diary
## Introduction
When you have a special memory, you would not want to lose it or forget about
it.
A wise sentence you heard in a fascinating lecture, people who influenced your
life during a trip to a distant country or your first love of youth. All those
memories, experiences, are what shape your personality and define who you are
today.
## Main Goal
Because most of the moments in your lives you tend to forget or not remember
in the long run the details of the experience that moved you and influenced you,
our main goal is to develop a place where you can record into your personal
diary every beautiful moment and remember it for the rest of your life.
All your memories will be within reach in the application that acts as your
personal diary, so you can view and add new memories at any given moment.
